# Exploring Linfa: Machine Learning in Rust ðŸš€

Divng into Rust's growing machine learning ecosystem with Linfaâ€”a framework built for performance and safety. This project is about deepening my understanding by implementing core linear algebra operations from scratch. Therefore getting closer to an understanding of the C++ implemntations of libraries like PyTorch  ðŸ“š

## Why Linfa?
Linfa showcases Rustâ€™s potential in machine learning, offering robust algorithms and tools designed with Rustâ€™s strict safety and concurrency guarantees. By working with Linfa, we're pushing the boundaries of traditional ML development, exploring the intersection of cutting-edge technology and foundational mathematics.

## Pure Knowledge Expansion
This endeavor is driven purely by curiosity and a passion for learning. Itâ€™s about mastering the mechanics behind ML algorithms, and appreciating the power of Rust in delivering high-performance, safe, and efficient systems. ðŸ¦€

## Join the Journey
Let's explore the depths of Rust, Linfa, and linear algebra together, gaining insights that will serve as a strong foundation for future projects.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
